      <p>Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in which two teams of five players compete to destroy a <br>
        large structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient" while defending their own.
        Like Defense of the Ancients, the game is controlled using Stan Dard real-time strategy <br>
        controls, and is presented on a single map in a three-dimensional isometric perspective. <br>
        Ten players each control one of the game's 123 playable characters, called "heroes",<br>
         each with their own designs, strengths, and weaknesses. Heroes are divided into two primary roles, called core and support..</p>
