   <h1> Thomas J. waston founder of BIM </h1><br><br>
     <p1> Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 – June 19, 1956) was an American businessman who served as the chairman and CEO of IBM.[1][2] He oversaw the company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson developed IBM's management style and corporate culture from John Henry Patterson's training at NCR.[3] He turned the company into a highly effective selling organization, based largely on punched card tabulating machines. A leading self-made industrialist,[4] he was one of the richest men of his time and was called the world's greatest salesman when he died in 1956.

Today the main shareholder is Mustafa Latif Topbaş.[7] At the beginning BİM had only 21 stores, but it expanded thoroughly and by the end of 2015 it counted 4972[8] and 2019, 7438 stores [6] by the third quarter of 2021, the company operated 10.330 stores.
